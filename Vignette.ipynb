    "# Vignette: Using the nys_parole_scraper package\n",
    "\n",
    "### MDS Final Project: Kellyann Hayes\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Read the Docs: https://nys-parole-scraper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n",
    "##### TestPyPi: https://test.pypi.org/project/nys-parole-scraper/\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the ReamMe documentation, given an input of a csv file with identifying information of individuals (NYSID (New York state ID) or Name and DOB), this package will search for them via the [New York State DOCCS parolee lookup](https://publicapps.doccs.ny.gov/ParoleeLookup/default) and return all parole information, and summary statistics, for the individuals who are found in the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "This aim of this package is to aid in the data collection efforts for organization serving justice-involved populations in New York State; as such, it prioritizes accessibility for non-programmers by keeping it simple and exporting data directly as CSV and Excel files to a directory on your computer. However, the package can also be used to manipulate and perform analysis on data by returning them as python objects. Organizations working with justice-involved people in New York State may find that they are in need of parole data for multiple reasons, including program evaluation; program planning and design; understanding the parole needs of their participants; and reporting to funders. Organzations with a large number of clients who either are on parole or may be on parole can use this scraper to establish which of their clients are on parole; details about the parole including current status, release date, and charge information; information about the parole officer, which may help organizations in providing advocacy services; charge information; etc. The package will also return some basic summary statsitics and frequency tables to give an overview of the data. For the full list of data collected by the scraper, please visit the package ReadMe. \n",
    "\n",
    "This vignette runs through a brief example of the use of the parole_scraper on a sample of names collected randomly from the DOCCS parolee lookup (mostly John Does, Jane Does, etc). To note, the scraper is able to search for individuals by two means: \n",
    "\n",
    "- NYSID, if provided and if valid \n",
    "- Name and Year of Birth, if first name, last name, and DOB are all provided\n",
    "- (See the ReadMe for more detailed information on how this data is provided in a csv file input.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this a random sample taken from the parole lookup tool itself, and NYSID is not available in any of the DOCCS lookup tools, I was unable to search by NYSID for this example (though I did include some fake input data with NYSIDs to demonstrate that the scraper is able to search by NYSID and exclude invalid NYSIDs). The scraper has been tested with \"real\" data for which I had NYSIDs (but will not use in this example to protect confidentiality), and is effective in that usage as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, I import the package and assign the path of my csv file containing my test data (see the ReadMe for detailed information about the csv file format).\n",
    "(Please note that I'm having an issue on my personal computer in which dependencies that are already installed are not being recognized during pip install - which is why I installed using --no-deps after ensuring that I do indeed have everything installed. Ususally, the package can be installed using:\n",
    "```pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ nys-parole-scraper```"
